**NBomber** - Distributed load-testing framework for .NET.
It is designed to test any system regardless of the protocol (HTTP/WebSockets/AMQP) or a semantic model (Pull/Push).
It allows to write distributed load test scenarios in plain C# or F#.

NBomber as a modern framework provides:
- Zero dependencies on protocol (HTTP/WebSockets/AMQP/SQL)
- Zero dependencies on semantic model (Pull/Push)
- Very flexible configuration and dead simple API
- **Native Debug** - debug your tests using your favorite IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)
- [Informative Reports](https://nbomber.com/docs/reporting/reports): [HTML](https://nbomber.com/assets/reports/html_report.html)
- Realtime reporting:
    - [NBomber Studio](https://nbomber.com/docs/nbomber-studio/overview) - is a powerful management tool designed by NBomber. Monitor tests in real time with NBomber Studio and conduct detailed result analysis to identify trends.
    - [Reporting Sinks](https://nbomber.com/docs/nbomber/reporting-sinks) for integration with popular systems for real-time monitoring

### Why we build NBomber and what you can do with it?
The main reason behind NBomber is to provide a lightweight framework for writing load tests which you can use to test literally any system and simulate any production workload. We wanted to provide only a few abstractions so that we could describe any type of load and still have a simple, intuitive API.
Another goal is to provide building blocks to validate your POC (proof of concept) projects by applying any complex load distribution.
With NBomber you can test any PULL or PUSH system (HTTP, WebSockets, GraphQl, gRPC, SQL Databse, MongoDb, Redis etc).
With NBomber you can convert some of your integration tests to load tests easily.

### What makes it very simple?
One of the design goals of NBomber is to keep API as minimal as possible.
Because of this, NBomber focuses on fully utilizing programming language(C#/F#) constructs instead of reinventing a new DSL that should be learned.
In other words, if you want to write a for loop, you don't need to learn a DSL for this.

```csharp
var scenario = Scenario.Create("hello_world_scenario", async context =>
{
    // you can define and execute any logic here,
    // for example: send http request, SQL query etc
    // NBomber will measure how much time it takes to execute your logic
    await Task.Delay(1_000);

    return Response.Ok();
})
.WithLoadSimulations(
    Simulation.Inject(rate: 10,
                      interval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
                      during: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30))
);

NBomberRunner
    .RegisterScenarios(scenario)
    .Run();
```
